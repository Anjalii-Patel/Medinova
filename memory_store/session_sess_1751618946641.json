That's a big task!\n\nCan I help clarify something for you? You mentioned earlier that you need to create a new employee account, but then you jumped straight into assigning roles and rights. Can you tell me what kind of support or guidance are you looking for in this process? Are there any specific steps or areas where you're feeling stuck?\n\nAlso, what is the main goal of integrating HRMS with HMIS for your organization? Is it to streamline certain processes, improve employee data management, or something else entirely?\n\nFollow-up: Could you tell me your symptom duration, triggers?"
