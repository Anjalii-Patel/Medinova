That's a pretty complex project!\n\nCan you tell me more about the current state of your HMIS and HRMS systems? What kind of data are we talking about transferring, and what kind of integrations do you need to set up?\n\nAlso, have you identified any specific pain points or challenges with the current integration process? Are there any existing APIs or interfaces that I should be aware of?\n\nLastly, what's the ultimate goal for this integration project? Is it to improve employee onboarding, streamline benefits management, or something else entirely?\n\nFollow-up: Could you tell me your symptom duration, triggers?"
