      "text": "Hello! It sounds like you're going through a lot of changes with HRMS integration. Are there any specific areas that are causing you trouble or would you like some general guidance on how to get started?\n\nAlso, I noticed you mentioned creating new employee accounts and setting up user logins. Have you considered implementing a role-based access control system? It might help streamline the process and ensure that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive information.\n\nIf you're feeling overwhelmed, we could break down the tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. What do you think would be the most helpful next step?\n\n(By the way, is everything okay? You mentioned HRMS integration earlier, but I didn't catch any other concerns or questions. Is there something specific on your mind that you'd like to discuss?)\n\nFollow-up: Could you tell me your symptom duration, triggers?"
