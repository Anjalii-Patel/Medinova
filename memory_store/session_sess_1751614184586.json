Can you tell me more about the issue you're facing? Are there any specific steps in the workflow that's not working as expected? \n\nAlso, I noticed that there are some repeated sections in your workflow. Is that intentional or is it something that might be simplified for easier understanding?\n\nFollow-up: Could you tell me your symptom duration, triggers?"
